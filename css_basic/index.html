        <h2>Creation and background</h2>
        <p>
          John James Rambo (born July 6, 1947) is a fictional character in the
          Rambo franchise.[1] He first appeared in the 1972 novel First Blood by
          David Morrell, but later became more famous as the protagonist of the
          film series, in which he was played by Sylvester Stallone. The
          portrayal of the character earned Stallone widespread acclaim and
          recognition. The character was nominated for American Film Institute's
          list 100 Years…100 Heroes and Villains.[2] The term "Rambo" is
          commonly used to describe a lone wolf who is reckless, disregards
          orders, uses violence to solve all problems, enters dangerous
          situations alone, and is exceptionally tough, callous, raw and
          aggressive.[3]
        </p>
        <p>
          Morrell says that in choosing the name Rambo he was inspired by "the
          sound of force" in the name of Rambo apples, which he encountered in
          Pennsylvania. These apples, in turn, were named for Peter Gunnarsson
          Rambo, who sailed from Sweden to America in the 1640s, and soon the
          name would flourish in New Sweden. The name Rambo was likely derived
          from a shortened form of Ramberget (a hill on the Hisingen island in
          Gothenburg, where Peter Gunnarsson was born) plus "bo" (meaning
          "resident of"). Today, many of his descendants can still be found in
          this region of the US. Morrell also felt that its pronunciation was
          similar to the surname of Arthur Rimbaud, the title of whose most
          famous work, A Season in Hell, seemed to him "an apt metaphor for the
          prisoner-of-war experiences that I imagined Rambo suffering".[4]
          Furthermore, an Arthur J. Rambo was an actual U.S. soldier in Vietnam,
          but he never returned.[5] His name can be seen on the Vietnam War
          Memorial wall in Washington, DC. He was granted the first name "John"
          as a reference to the song "When Johnny Comes Marching Home
          Again".[6][7]

        <h3>Fictional biography</h3>
        <p>
          According to "Rambo: Last Blood", the character's full name is John
          Rambo. He was born on July 6, 1947, in Bowie, Arizona, to father
          Reevis Rambo (1922–2000) and mother Helga Rambo (1926–1969), as shown
          on the graves at Rambo's farm in Rambo: Last Blood. In Rambo: First
          Blood Part II, he is said to be of Native American and German descent;
          the character Major Marshall Roger T. Murdock says: "Of Indian and
          German descent. That's a hell of a combination!" The film's
          novelization reveals he has an Italian father and a Navajo mother.
          John's niece, Shirlene, is also well known. Rambo enlisted in the U.S.
          Army at the age of 17, on August 6, 1964, although he states in Rambo
          that he was "drafted into Vietnam". After he graduated from Rangeford
          High School in 1965, his military service began in January 1966. Rambo
          was deployed to South Vietnam in September 1966. He returned to the
          U.S. in 1967 and began training with the U.S. Army Special Forces at
          Fort Bragg, North Carolina, under Colonel Samuel Trautman's tutelage.
        </p>
        <p>
          In late 1969, Rambo was re-deployed to Vietnam as a member of a SOG
          brigade. He became part of a Special Forces Long-range reconnaissance
          patrol unit, commanded by Colonel Trautman. Trautman's team received
          the code name of Baker Team and usually consisted of eight men. Other
          known members were Delmar Barry (a black operative who quickly became
          Rambo's best friend), Joseph "Joey" Danforth (another friend of
          Rambo's), Manuel "Loco" Ortega, Paul Messner, Delbert Krackhauer,
          Giuseppe "Greasy Cunt" Colletta, and Ralph Jorgenson. In an event that
          would haunt Rambo for the rest of his life, Danforth died in Rambo's
          arms, after being fatally wounded by a rigged shoeshine box while
          their unit was on rest and recuperation time.
