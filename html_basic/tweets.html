      <p>According to "Rambo: Last Blood", the character's full name is John Rambo. He was born on July 6, 1947, in Bowie, Arizona, to father Reevis Rambo (1922–2000) and mother Helga Rambo (1926–1969), as shown on the graves at Rambo's farm in Rambo: Last Blood. In Rambo: First Blood Part II, he is said to be of Native American and German descent; the character Major Marshall Roger T. Murdock says: "Of Indian and German descent. That's a hell of a combination!" The film's novelization reveals he has an Italian father and a Navajo mother. John's niece, Shirlene, is also well known. Rambo enlisted in the U.S. Army at the age of 17, on August 6, 1964, although he states in Rambo that he was "drafted into Vietnam". After he graduated from Rangeford High School in 1965, his military service began in January 1966. Rambo was deployed to South Vietnam in September 1966. He returned to the U.S. in 1967 and began training with the U.S. Army Special Forces at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, under Colonel Samuel Trautman's tutelage.
